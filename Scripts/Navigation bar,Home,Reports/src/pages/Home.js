      <h1>Elastic Prediction System</h1><br/>
      <p> WOVEN FABRIC (WF) composites form one of the important classes of textile WF composites.
          They offer <br/>certain advantages over conventional unidirectional(UD)<br/>
           laminated composites which have made them attractive for structural ap-plications. 
          Complicated shapes<br/> can be obtained by using WF composites.It is easier to<br/> build thick laminates with woven fabrics than with UD tapes. 
           Thehandling of woven fabrics is easier.<br/>Therefore, the labour in making thicklaminates is also reduced. 
           WF composites also offer higher impact<br/> resistance,toughness and dimensional stability. 
           The elastic analysis of WF composites is necessary since the advantages are obtained at the cost of in-plane stiffness prop-erties.
